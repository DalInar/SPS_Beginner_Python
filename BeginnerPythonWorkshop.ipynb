    "# Beginner Python Workshop\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world due to its high versatility and ease of use.  Python can be used for data manipulation and analysis, file input and output, visualization, numerical computation, curve fitting, machine learning, etc. Python is also an interpretted language, which means that the code is read and turned into machine code in real time by an 'intepretter', rather than being compiled ahead of time.  This allows quick and interactive development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we'll look at some of the basic features built into Python, and then we'll see how to make Python really powerful with libraries.\n",

    "Percolation problems involve a lattice of sites.  The lattice can be of any shape and dimension, but here we are going to consider a 2 dimensional square lattice.  We then say that each lattice site can be occupied with probability $p$, and then study the patterns of occupied sites that result."

    "The object of study in percolation theory are the clusters of occupied sites, and how they change depending on $p$, the shape of the lattice, and the size of the lattice.  A cluster of sites is a group of occupied sites that are attached (or adjacent) to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly interesting question is when *percolating clusters* form, which are clusters that stretch the entire way across the lattice, either from left to right or top to bottom.  It turns out that these clusters start to exist around a critical value of $p$, called $p_c$.  The transition from not having to having percolating clusters is one of the simplest (but still nontrivial!) phase transitions, and leads into interesting fields of study like fractals, critical scaling, and universality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to study the behavior of a percolation problem, we need algorithms that can identify clusters on a lattice. Luckily, these algorithms are well developed and containing in libraries like [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.measurements.label.html), mostly due to their importance in image processing.  Here we'll use these algorithms to label the unique clusters and figure out it a percolating cluster exists."
